### Scripts
|Name|Language|Technologies|Purpose|
|-|-|-|-|
|Sys Commands/Connect To BT Speaker|Python|Linux|Learning how to control system processes from Python. Wrote a script to control the "bluetoothctl" process, and use it to connect to a bluetooth speaker that I own (and that Ubuntu doesn't reliably pair to through the desktop environment!)|
|Selenium Router Reset|Python|Selenium|Learning how to use Selenium. Wrote a script to log in to my home router, detect if the internet is connected, and if not, toggle the ADSL connection off and then back on, and then test the connection again. Needed to use Selenium over using SSH to connect to the router as I couldn't find the user + pwd details for my make & model.|
|YouTube Playlist Script|Python|OAuth, Flask, REST (over HTTP), YouTube Data API|Wrote a script to get a playlist, order the tracks by ascending publish timestamp, and then add them to a new playlist in my own account. Along the way learnt about OAuth, the Flask web server library, using a REST API in Python, and using the YouTube Data API in Python|
